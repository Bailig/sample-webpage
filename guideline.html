                    <div>
                        <h3>Step One: Data Preparation</h3>
                        <p>Eleven comma-delimited tables in CSV format and a JSON format file will be created through the provided script tools.</p>
                        <p>The eleven CSV tables contain the data that are required to locate the collections on the map, and each CSV file contains a particular predefined group of collections.</p>
                        <p>The JSON file contains all the detailed information except location information. It will be used to show the description and image of the collections. The screenshot here shows one CSV and JSON example.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Step Two: Add Data to ArcGIS Online</h3>
                        <p>Add the eleven CSV format files into your ArcGIS web map. Each CSV file will be a layer in the web map. The names of the layers and the order they are listed in your map are used by the story map tabs. The screenshot here shows eleven point layers added to the web map, which will each define one tab in the story map.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Step Three: Configure The Story Map Template</h3>
                        <p>Configure the Shortlist template to use your web map by editing the index.html file. You can open this file in the editor of your choice. In the Config section of the file, edit the WEBMAP_ID variable to be the ID of your web map.</p>
                        <p>Put the JSON format file in the spesific location with spesific file name.</p>

                            In this step, we will add the 11 CSV format files into your ArcGIS web map. In your web map, zoom and pan to the area you want users to see when they first open your Story Map, and save your map. The title you save your map as is used as the title of your Story Map, and the summary is used as the subtitle.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Log in to ArcGIS Online using a free, non-commercial ArcGIS public account or an ArcGIS subscription account, and create a new web map. Choose the basemap you want to use.</li>
                            <li>Add the 11 CSV format files into your ArcGIS web map by clicking on "Add Layer From File". Each CSV file will be a layer in the web map. The names of the layers and the order they are listed in your map are used by the story map tabs.</li>
                            <li>In your web map, zoom and pan to the area you want users to see when they first open your Story Map, and save your map. The title you save your map as is used as the title of your Story Map, and the summary is used as the subtitle.</li>
                            <li>Share your web map. Normally you share your web map publicly so anyone can access your Story Map. But you also have the option, if you are using an ArcGIS subscription account, to share your map just within your organization if your Story Map is not intended for use by the general public.</li>
