                    <div>
                        <h3>Step One: Data Preparation</h3>
                        <p>Eleven comma-delimited tables in CSV format and a JSON format file will be created through the provided script tools.</p>
                        <p>The eleven CSV tables contain the data that are required to locate the collections on the map, and each CSV file contains a particular predefined group of collections.</p>
                        <p>The JSON file contains all the detailed information except location information. It will be used to show the description and image of the collections. The screenshot here shows one CSV and JSON example.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Step Two: Add Data to ArcGIS Online</h3>
                        <p>Add the eleven CSV format files into your ArcGIS web map. Each CSV file will be a layer in the web map. The names of the layers and the order they are listed in your map are used by the story map tabs. The screenshot here shows eleven point layers added to the web map, which will each define one tab in the story map.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Step Three: Configure The Story Map Template</h3>
                        <p>Configure the Shortlist template to use your web map by editing the index.html file. You can open this file in the editor of your choice. In the Config section of the file, edit the WEBMAP_ID variable to be the ID of your web map.</p>
                        <p>Put the JSON format file in the spesific location with spesific file name.</p>

                    <h2>Story Map Cost</h2>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Time Cost</h3>
                        <p>The time cost of this story map project can vary from a few hours to a couple of weeks depending on the condition of input data, required software, and the technician who is responsible for the project.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the format of input data is changed in the future, the provided script tool that implements the data to meet the requirement may have to be modified to work properly.</li>
                            <li>Visual Studio, an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft, and an IDE for Python, will be needed to run these script tools to prepare the data. If the software is not installed yet, it would take some time to install.</li>
                            <li>The understanding of Python and C# programming language of the technician will determine how long it is going to take to prepare the data when the changes are needed. A good grasp of the two programming languages and the software mentioned above will help to speed up the story map creation process. However, there will be well-written comments for the code as well as a written guide to assist the technical person.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Financial Cost</h3>
                        <p>The financial cost can also vary from zero to thousand of dollars depending on the volume of data input and the software supports of the time.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ArcGIS online provides a free account that can be used to create the story map. However, it has a limitation on the input data. Therefore, the museum would need to purchase an annual subscription, if a large volume of data input is needed.</li>
                            <li>Visual Studio is not a free tool; therefore, the museum might need to purchase it to be able to run the script tools, if they do not have one yet.</li>
                        </ul>
